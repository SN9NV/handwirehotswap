# Building the matrix

## Wiring a Matrix Col

1. Put all the switches into the board body

2. You will need many socket pieces and a long length of solid core wire

3. Bend a small section of the solid core wire into a 90 degree angle

4. Insert the short piece into the pin hole of the hot swap socket. The rest of the wire can exit from left or right of the socket body, but for this tutorial it will exit like in the image. Press the solid core wire deep into the wire channel

5. Pop the socket onto the switch. Do this carefully, and make sure the switch pin isn't bent

6. Fold the wire towards the next switch pin

7. Make a tight 90 degree bend a small distance away from the switch pin

8. Thread another hot swap socket onto the wire. Note the orientation of the socket as the wire goes in

9. The socket should slide past the 90 degree bend

10. Press the wire into the channel

11. Pop the socket onto the switch. Again, be careful as to not bend the switch pin

12. Rinse and repeat until you're done with the column. Trim any excess wire as necessary

## Wiring a Matrix Row

1. Wire up the columns as per the above instructions

2. Snake a length of solid core wire across the entire row, making sure to cross UNDER the column wires. The difficulty of this will depend on how weird your board is and how tightly you wired the columns.

3. Position the wire over the bottom wire channel. This can be done by hands or with a tool

4. Stab the wire into the channel using a flathead screwdriver. Be sure to press along the entire wire channel to maximize the chance of forming a solid electrical connection

5. Position the wire

6. Stab the wire in. Position the next wire
