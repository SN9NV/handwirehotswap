# Building a Socket

1. Lay the diode in the diode channel

2. Use your nail to mark where this diode leg would bend into the hole

3. Bend the diode leg to 90 degrees. Ideally, the radius of the bend should be small

4. Slot the bent leg into the hole. Use your fingernail and mark where the other diode leg would bend into the hole

5. Bend the diode leg to 90 degrees. Again, try to make the radius of the bend small

6. Slot diode into the socket

7. Turning the socket over, bend the legs 90 degrees into their wire channels. Use a screwdriver to force them into the slot if necessary

8. Bend one leg so it rests over the top wire channel

9. Use a flathead screwdriver to force the wire into the wire channel. Notice how the wire appears recessed in this photo

10. Bend the other leg so it rests over the bottom wire channel

11. Use a flathead to push the wire to the bottom of the channel. This wire will be a loose fit in the bottom wire channel

13. Do a fit check on the socket. Ideally, the switch pin in the green circle squeezes itself between the 2 wires

14. Bend the remaining leg wires around the body
