A 3D printed, Solderless Hot Swap Socket to build keyswitch matrixes

**v4 is in development**

v4 brings significant improvements, including:
- Easier to print
  - Important dimensions are now printed on the top face, reducing problems caused by first layer horizontal expansion
  - Much easier to press the switch into the socket now
- Improved robustness of row wire connection
  - Row wire can now be clamped down onto the diode wire
- Faster to assemble / put in diode
  - Less precision required, more brute force expected
- Better method of connecting pin and diode
  - v3 had a nasty tendency to crush the upper switch leaf, especially considering the amount of force required to put the switch into a v3 socket.
  - New design has an escape path for the pin if misaligned, and a better way of making electrical connection overall.

## Building a Socket

1. Lay the diode in the diode channel

![](img/socket/1.jpg)

2. Use your nail to mark where this diode leg would bend into the hole

![](img/socket/2.jpg)

3. Bend the diode leg to 90 degrees. Ideally, the radius of the bend should be small

![](img/socket/3.jpg)

4. Slot the bent leg into the hole. Use your fingernail and mark where the other diode leg would bend into the hole

5. Bend the diode leg to 90 degrees. Again, try to make the radius of the bend small

6. Slot diode into the socket

7. Turning the socket over, bend the legs 90 degrees into their wire channels. Use a screwdriver to force them into the slot if necessary

8. Bend one leg so it rests over the top wire channel

![](img/socket/8.jpg)

9. Use a flathead screwdriver to force the wire into the wire channel. Notice how the wire appears recessed in this photo

10. Bend the other leg so it rests over the bottom wire channel

![](img/socket/10.jpg)

11. Use a flathead to push the wire to the bottom of the channel. This wire will be a loose fit in the bottom wire channel

![](img/socket/12.jpg)

13. Do a fit check on the socket. Ideally, the switch pin in the green circle squeezes itself between the 2 wires

14. Bend the remaining leg wires around the body

## Wiring a Matrix Col

1. Put all the switches into the board body

![](img/matrix/col/0.jpg)

2. You will need many socket pieces and a long length of solid core wire

![](img/matrix/col/1.jpg)

3. Bend a small section of the solid core wire into a 90 degree angle

![](img/matrix/col/2.jpg)

4. Insert the short piece into the pin hole of the hot swap socket. The rest of the wire can exit from left or right of the socket body, but for this tutorial it will exit like in the image. Press the solid core wire deep into the wire channel

5. Pop the socket onto the switch. Do this carefully, and make sure the switch pin isn't bent

![](img/matrix/col/4.jpg)

6. Fold the wire towards the next switch pin

![](img/matrix/col/5.jpg)

7. Make a tight 90 degree bend a small distance away from the switch pin

![](img/matrix/col/6.jpg)

8. Thread another hot swap socket onto the wire. Note the orientation of the socket as the wire goes in

![](img/matrix/col/7.jpg)

9. The socket should slide past the 90 degree bend

![](img/matrix/col/8.jpg)

10. Press the wire into the channel

![](img/matrix/col/9.jpg)

11. Pop the socket onto the switch. Again, be careful as to not bend the switch pin

![](img/matrix/col/10.jpg)

12. Rinse and repeat until you're done with the column. Trim any excess wire as necessary

## Wiring a Matrix Row

1. Wire up the columns as per the above instructions

![](img/matrix/row/0.jpg)

2. Snake a length of solid core wire across the entire row, making sure to cross UNDER the column wires. The difficulty of this will depend on how weird your board is and how tightly you wired the columns.

3. Position the wire over the bottom wire channel. This can be done by hands or with a tool

![](img/matrix/row/2.jpg)

4. Stab the wire into the channel using a flathead screwdriver. Be sure to press along the entire wire channel to maximize the chance of forming a solid electrical connection

![](img/matrix/row/3.jpg)

5. Position the wire

![](img/matrix/row/4.jpg)

6. Stab the wire in. Position the next wire

![](img/matrix/row/5.jpg)

7. Stab the wire in

8. Finished Result
