**v4 is in development**

v4 brings significant improvements, including:
- Easier to print
  - Important dimensions are now printed on the top face, reducing problems caused by first layer horizontal expansion
  - Much easier to press the switch into the socket now
- Improved robustness of row wire connection
  - Row wire can now be clamped down onto the diode wire
- Faster to assemble / put in diode
  - Less precision required, more brute force expected
- Better method of connecting pin and diode
  - v3 had a nasty tendency to crush the upper switch pin, especially considering the amount of force required to put the switch into a v3 socket.
  - New design has an escape path for the pin if misaligned, and a better way of making electrical connection overall.
