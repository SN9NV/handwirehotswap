# Building Sockets

Lay diode in the diode slot, making sure to use the correct orientation

Press the diode and wire into their slots

Grab the diode leg and bend it up to form a tight 90 degree angle

Also bend the other leg into the slot. Easier to work if that wire is out of the way

Using a small round dowel like a precision screwdriver shaft, bend the wire leg 180 degrees around the shaft

Using fingers, crush the bend into a teardrop shape

Wrap the remaining diode leg wire around the body using 2x 90 degree angle bends

Fold the teardrop onto the wire to keep it in place

Using a fingernail, force the other diode leg into the row wire channel

Using the screwdriver, wrap the wire 360 degrees around the shaft. Its okay to translate while rotating to more easily make the full rotation

Form a loop using the bends, trying to keep the loop centered

Seat the remaining diode wire into the row slot

Thats how you make a socket! Perform some switch fit tests to make sure everything is in order.
